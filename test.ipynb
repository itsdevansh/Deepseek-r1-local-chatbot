      "Looking at the structure they provided, I see fields like summary, location, description, start and end times with time zones, recurrence, attendees, and reminders. \n",
      "\n",
      "I notice that in their example response, they filled in most of these fields but left some placeholders for me to ask about if information was missing. So, my job is to check each field and see if I can extract the necessary details from the user's input.\n",
      "\n",
      "The event summary isn't provided yet, so I should probably set a default like \"University of Ottawa Conference\" since that's what they mentioned in their request.\n",
      "\n",
      "For location, it's specified as the University of Ottawa, but maybe adding a more specific room or venue could be helpful. However, since the user didn't mention any particular room, I might leave it as just the university unless I can infer something else from context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The description is currently empty. Including an event description would make the calendar entry clearer and help attendees understand what's happening. So, I should prompt them to add a description or summary of the conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the start time, they provided 11:00 AM, but it's in Pacific Time (PT) because the user mentioned \"America/Los_Angeles\" as the timezone. However, if the event is happening east coast time, I might need to adjust that. Wait, noâ€”the user specified Los Angeles, so the event should be set in PT.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end time is 2:00 PM, which seems straightforward. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrence is daily with a count of 1, so that's fine as it is since they only want one occurrence on February 5th.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attendees are currently empty because there are none required. The user specified no attendees, so I don't need to collect any emails here.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reminders, the user wants email and popup notifications at specific times: 24 hours before (so 11 AM on the 3rd) and 10 minutes after starting (which would be 11:10 AM). That seems good, but I should make sure that's correctly formatted in the response.\n",
